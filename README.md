# Implementation of Space Invaders in C
An implementation of Space Invader with Allegro libs with minimal operations. I plan to further develop this project in future. Yes, I know there are memory leaks, no error handle, but as I said, I'll fix them as time goes by (actually this more like a reminder for myself than an text to anyone who read this).

# Requirements
+ Must have Allegro libraries installed in your computer
+ C compiler
+ Works on linux systems only

# Installation
+ Git clone this repo
+ run ./build.sh

# How do I leave the game?
